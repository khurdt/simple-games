Please accept this letter as an expressed interest in the position of software developer at John Deere. I am passionate about developing websites and applications, especially when I know it will be of service to real people. With a track record of loyalty, dependability, and initiative, I hope to be an asset to your company and the clients you serve. 
While I am newer to the field of software developing, I am not without strong foundational skills that will carry me far in learning new ones. These skills have already been tested while independently building and maintaining a complex website for a General Contractor, McCoy Dewitt LLC in Lubbock, Texas. Furthermore, I have honed skills from my current position as a Repair and Maintenance Technician at X-Fab Texas including: working independently with excellence, troubleshooting, problem solving, and critical thinking. I’m confident these experiences will give me a running head start into this new position. 
Thank you for your time and consideration of me for this role. I am delighted by the opportunity to apply my knowledge at John Deere, one of the leading online training and placement organizations in the United States. As a software developer, my goal is to create solutions that will better serve the John Deere’s or client's needs and decrease any burdens. I recognize that much of our world is connected to tech now, and I would be honored to be in a role to use my talents to assist others in this area. I understand that there is much to learn in any new job, and I desire to increase my programming skills. I enjoy uncovering new ideas and would use them to advance John Deere's mission to serve the infrastructure for our rapidly growing world. I'm looking forward to learning more about the software developer position and about John Deere, and anticipate hearing from you soon.
